Escape from Tarkov, the popular extraction shooter, has introduced significant changes to its Scavengers (Scavs) based on recent player feedback. These updates aim to enhance gameplay and cater to player preferences, ensuring a more balanced and engaging experience.

## Key Changes

- **Delayed Scav Spawns**: Scavs will now spawn later into raids, specifically no earlier than 17 minutes after the start, aligning with player preferences expressed in a recent survey.
- **Improved Gear with Fence Rating**: Fence reputation will now have a more significant impact on Scav gear quality, offering better equipment to players with higher reputations.

## Player-Driven Enhancements

Battlestate Games, the developer of Escape from Tarkov, revealed that these changes were driven by player surveys. They also highlighted that a substantial portion of players prefer peaceful Scav interactions, reinforcing the benefits of non-aggressive playstyles.

## Future Updates

The developer is committed to ongoing balance improvements, using telemetry data and player feedback. While further changes are anticipated, details remain under wraps as the game continues to refine its Scav gameplay.

Escape from Tarkov remains in beta, with no official version 1.0 release date announced. Stay tuned for upcoming updates as the game approaches its eighth anniversary in July 2025.
