Bethesda's Oblivion Remake Coming Sooner Than Expected
According to reliable industry insiders, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake in Unreal Engine 5 might be dropping very soon. This long-rumored project has reportedly been in development not by Bethesda's internal team, but by support studio Cervos.

What we know so far:
* The game features reworked systems and Unreal Engine 5 graphics
* Combat has been overhauled
* According to insider Nate the Hate (corroborated by VGC), the game is set for reveal in the coming weeks
* It could release before June, possibly as early as April
* A "shadow drop" (surprise release with minimal time between announcement and launch) is likely

For Elder Scrolls fans, this remake could provide the perfect excuse to revisit the world of Cyrodiil with modern graphics and gameplay improvements.

Space Marine 3 Development Officially Underway
Hot on the heels of Space Marine 2's success, Saber Interactive has announced that development on Space Marine 3 has officially begun. While no specific details were shared, the publisher Focus Interactive described it as "an even bigger and more spectacular game" and "a true love letter to the Warhammer 40K Universe."

The announcement suggests that the gap between sequels will be much shorter this time, compared to the lengthy wait between the first and second games. Space Marine 2 provided a solid foundation with its gameplay, and fans are optimistic that the third installment could elevate the series even further.

Silent Hill F Reveals First Major Details
Konami has presented the first substantial details for Silent Hill F (pronounced "F" not "Effing"), the new entry in the legendary horror series. The game is set in Japan during the 1960s and features dual composers—one legendary and one newer—creating music for different "worlds" within the game.

The developers emphasized their intention to lean heavily into Japanese influences for this installment, noting that while Silent Hill games have always had unique Japanese elements in their storytelling and aesthetics, Silent Hill F will fully embrace this approach.

The reveal trailer showcased some familiar horror elements but impressed with its distinctive environments and monster designs. No release date has been announced yet, but the developers appear confident about the project's direction.

Rainbow Six Siege X Launches Soon
Ubisoft has shared more details about Rainbow Six Siege X, which will be mostly free-to-play with certain paid content for ranked modes. The game will feature a new mode called "Dual Front" and is set to release on June 10th, with closed beta testing currently underway.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Reveals New Gameplay
A substantial 10-minute trailer for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was shown at South by Southwest, featuring new gameplay elements with an apparent emphasis on action sequences. The trailer also introduced a character that many fans believe resembles Solid Snake, in what appears to be Hideo Kojima's playful nod to his Metal Gear Solid legacy.

Pre-orders for the game are now available, including collector's editions. Early access will begin on June 24th, 2025, for those who purchase special editions.

Technical Issues Plague GTA 5 Online PC Migration
The transition to the new version of GTA 5 on PC has created significant problems for many players, including migration issues and progress loss. This comes at an unfortunate time for Rockstar Games, as player goodwill is already strained. Workarounds and assistance links are available for affected players.

Microtransactions Confirmed for New Skate Game
According to Insider Gaming, players in the closed alpha of the upcoming free-to-play Skate game have discovered microtransactions within the game. The system involves purchasing in-game currency with real money, which can then be used to buy cosmetic items and clothing.

While this development was largely expected given the free-to-play model, it has disappointed many longtime fans of the series. For those seeking alternatives, Session has received positive updates and might be worth checking out.

Mortal Kombat 1 Adds the T-1000

Is Dino Crisis Making a Comeback?
Capcom has renewed the "D-Crisis" trademark in Japan, leading to speculation about a possible revival of the Dino Crisis franchise. While trademark renewals are routine business for companies and don't necessarily indicate new projects, the current Capcom leadership has shown enthusiasm for revamping classic IPs.

Given Capcom's recent track record with successful remakes and revivals, there's reason for cautious optimism, but no official announcements have been made.

Gaming Trivia: Sony vs. Superbad
In an interesting piece of gaming-related movie trivia, Seth Rogen recently revealed that during the filming of Superbad, Sony (which produced the movie) didn't want Jonah Hill's character to physically interact with PlayStation products during a gaming scene with Michael Cera because they considered Hill's character "too vile" to be associated with their brand.
