## Background

A FlowHunt user recently encountered a technical issue when attempting to automate blog post creation to WordPress via the FlowHunt platform's integration. This blog post documents the issue, troubleshooting journey, and final resolution to help other users who might face a similar error.

## The User Experience

**Issue Encountered:**

> When using the WordPress integration to create blog posts, the user received the following error:
>
> `Error running graph: Error building Component Create WordPress Post: Constructor parameter should be str.`
>
> As a result, no blog posts were being generated on their WordPress site.

The user initially attempted to get help from the in-app AI chatbot, but did not receive a response.

## Troubleshooting & Initial Analysis

After checking their server, the user hypothesized that the issue might be related to limited memory or swap on their infrastructure. They planned to migrate their environment to a new server to mitigate any potential hardware limitations.

## FlowHunt Support Investigation

Upon contacting FlowHunt support, the technical team promptly reviewed the error logs and identified that the issue was not related to server memory, but rather a bug in the FlowHunt WordPress integration component. Specifically, the integration expected a string parameter in its constructor, but received a different type, triggering the error.

## Resolution

The FlowHunt team quickly patched the bug and released a fix the same day. Users affected by this issue were advised to try the integration again after the update, with the assurance that no changes to their server environment were necessary.

## Key Takeaways

- If you see a `Constructor parameter should be str` error when using the WordPress integration, it is likely an integration bug, not an infrastructure issue.
- Always reach out to FlowHunt support for error messages that are unclear or unexpected.
- The FlowHunt team monitors and resolves integration issues rapidly, ensuring minimal downtime for users.
- Server memory or swap limitations may cause other issues, but this particular error was not related to infrastructure.
