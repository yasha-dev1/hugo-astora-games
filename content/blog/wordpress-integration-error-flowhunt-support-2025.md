**User Follow-up:**

> Hi,
> 
> This issue might be related to memory on our server. Upon investigating, the current memory swap usage indicates we're operating in a very tight environment. Since we cannot upgrade the memory on the current server, we plan to create a clone and migrate to it.
> 
> If there are no errors on your end, we'll test it after the upgrade.

**FlowHunt Support Response:**

> Hi,
> 
> This seems to be an error from our side. We have spotted the issue and fixed it right away. In a release later today, the bug will be fixed. You can try it from tomorrow. This is not related to any memory issue on your server.

### Key Takeaways

- The initial error was due to a bug in FlowHunt’s WordPress integration, not a server memory issue.
- FlowHunt support quickly identified and resolved the problem, releasing a fix the same day.
- Users are encouraged to report integration errors directly, as internal platform errors may not always be related to their own infrastructure.
