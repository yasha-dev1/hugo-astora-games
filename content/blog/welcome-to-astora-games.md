We're thrilled to officially launch Astora Games, your new destination for retro-inspired browser games with a modern twist. Our mission is to create engaging, accessible games that combine the charm of classic arcade games with contemporary gameplay mechanics.

## Our Vision

At Astora Games, we believe that great games don't need to be complicated. We focus on:

- **Accessibility**: All our games run directly in your browser
- **Retro Aesthetics**: Beautiful pixel art and neon-cyberpunk visuals
- **Modern Gameplay**: Classic concepts reimagined with modern game design
- **Community Focus**: Built for and with our gaming community

## What's Coming

We're launching with our first title, Space Shooter, a modern take on the classic arcade shooter. But that's just the beginning! Here's what's in our pipeline:

1. **Pixel Dungeons**: A roguelike adventure game
2. **Neon Racer**: High-speed racing with a synthwave twist
3. **Cyber Defense**: Tower defense with a cyberpunk theme
